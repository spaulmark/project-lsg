# Hi, welcome to Project LSG!

This is an experimental interface I made for visualizing social networks as they change over time. It uses real data! 

## Show, don't tell

## What's the source on your data?

I spectated an online game of survivor, and kept track of the players's opinions on each other as the game progressed. Survivor is a game where the primary mechanic is that players eliminate each other by majority vote until only one winner remains, making it a good candidate for a social network analysis. Players voulenteered information to spectators in private forum threads. Because giving information to spectators was not compulsory, some players chose to give less information than others. As such, the data collected is not guarenteed to be 100% accurate or complete.

Here's a link to the forum where the game was played. Unless you've seen one of these before, you're probably not going to know what to do with it.
