# Hi, welcome to Project LSG!

This project is a secret right now! Only a few people know what to do with this page. If you're one of those people, just follow the instructions I've given you, and let me know what you think. Otherwise, you should just check back in a couple months.

## What is a community viewer for social networks?

A community viewer for social networks is something that makes sense of a small social network with a lot of edges.

You know how when you look at a really big graph, sometimes you can notice little groups and clusters of nodes that are mostly connected to each other? Those are called communities. In a social network, a community might be a classroom, a group of co-workers, or members of the same club. Communities can also have communities within them, like the popular girls that always eat lunch together.

Because most people talk to each other in a community, the resulting graph is very dense in edges and is hard to look at. Everybody has an opinion on everybody else, so displaying it like a graph to try to visualize it isn't very helpful, even for small communities. That's where this software comes in.

### What can I do right now? 

Maybe do some reading on community visualziation: Look up "NodeTrix" and "Social Network Visualization" on Google Scholar and start reading papers until you're excited about this problem as I am.
